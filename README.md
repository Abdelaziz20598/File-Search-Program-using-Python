# File-Search-Program-using-Python

This program is an efficient search tool that helps users easily find files. The program has multiple search options that allow users to find the files they need.
 The "contain" and The "start with" buttons can be used to search for files by name, even if the user's memory is not clear about the full name. 
 The "ends with" buttons can be used to search for files by file extension.

The program can also be used to search for files by date, whether it is the modification date or the creation date. After searching, users can know the number of files that were found, which they can easily specify.

The program features an easy-to-use user interface and powerful search functions, making it an ideal tool for people who constantly search for files and need to find them quickly and easily."
